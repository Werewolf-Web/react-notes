===    React intro  == 

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components.

==  How it's work  == 

React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
React only changes what needs to be changed!

==  Why do we install Node.js to run React?  ==

✔ React depends on Node to compile JSX
✔ React needs Node for development server
✔ React uses NPM to install packages
✔ Browsers cannot run JSX directly

👉 We install Node because React needs it to run, compile, and manage packages.

==   ✅ What is node_modules ?  ==

node_modules is a folder that stores all the packages (libraries) your project needs to run.


==  🚀 What is Vite?  ==

Vite is a fast build tool and development server used to create modern web apps like React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

It replaces older tools like Create React App and Webpack because it is MUCH faster.

==  What is JSX?  ==

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML in React.

component:
 1. function

			const ComponentName = () => {
				return (
				<div>
					Hello React!
				</div>
				);
			};

			export default ComponentName;


 2. class component

		   class Car extends React.Component {
  				render() {
    				return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
					}
				}	
 
 ==  == Props == == 

 => Props are arguments passed into React components.
 => props stands for properties.

	Syntex / Example :

	function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="John" />
    </div>
  );
}
	-------------
export default App;

function Greet(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greet;










======================
hooks:
	useState:  state manage krva mate
	useReducer: Manage complex thinks/items and state
	useEffect:  side effect handle krva mate like:(API call, dom,evevnt)
	useRef: mutebale value ne hold krva / rerender ne trigger thata atkavu,dom Acssess krva
	useContext: globale stte manage krva (without propes)
	useMemo,usecallback:  perfomence optimizaton krva,unnecessary re-render ne atkava



** useState  **

const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

state: The current state value.
setState: A function used to update the state.
initialValue: The default value of the state when the component first renders.

# simple code to change the state value 10 to 20: 

	const[a,setA]=useStste(10);
	
	fuction changea(){
	setA(20)
	}

	<h1>value change {a}</h1>
	<button onClick={changea}>click</button>
