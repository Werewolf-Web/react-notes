==== JavaScript intro  ====   ✅   


 ✅ JavaScript is a programming language commonly used to create interactive and dynamic behavior on websites.

JavaScript keywords are case-sensitive. (so here the apple / APPLE both are the same variable count )

👉 but in that case ( The variables lastName and lastname, are different variables: )




=== JavaScript variable ===

let == it was change the value when user need it (secure ) / you can declare let variableName ones time , second time you not declare let as same name / but you can change the let value

const == const don't change the value (fix value)

var == it was work same as let 

👉 var a ; => that call a declaration of variable
👉 var a = "hello world" => declaration / initialization  variable


================  Scope ===========

global scope = acsses in anywere in code

function scope = acsses in function

block scope = where you use {..}  there you use bolck scope 

✅  primitives -> primitive values are copied, not referenced.

                    Primitive Data Types:
                        string → "hello"
                        number → 10, 3.14
                        boolean → true, false
                        null → intentional empty value
                        undefined → variable declared but not assigned
                        bigint → 123n
                        symbol → Symbol("id")

✅  reference ->  Reference types store references (addresses) to objects in memory, not the actual value.

                    Reference Data Types:
                        Object
                        Array
                        Function
                        Date
                        Set, Map, etc.

=======  JavaScript Arithmetic  =====

+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

=======  JavaScrip Assignment  =====

Operator   Example     Same As        Result
------------------------------------------------
=          x = y       x = y          x = 5
+=         x += y      x = x + y      x = 15
-=         x -= y      x = x - y      x = 5
*=         x *= y      x = x * y      x = 50
**=        x **= y     x = x ** y     x = 100000
/=         x /= y      x = x / y      x = 2
%=         x %= y      x = x % y      x = 0
:          x: 45       size.x = 45    x = 45

  Logical Assignment Operators

Operator   Example        Result
-----------------------------------------
&&=        true &&= 10    x = 10
||=        false ||= 10   x = 10
??=        null ??= 10    x = 10


========  JavaScript Comparison   ===========

Operator   Description                        Comparing      Returns
------------------------------------------------------------------------
==         equal to                           x == 8         false
                                              x == 5         true
                                              x == "5"       true

===        equal value and equal type         x === 5        true
                                              x === "5"      false

!=         not equal                          x != 8         true

!==        not equal value or type            x !== 5        false
                                              x !== "5"      true
                                              x !== 8        true

>          greater than                       x > 8          false

<          less than                          x < 8          true

>=         greater than or equal to           x >= 8         false

<=         less than or equal to              x <= 8         true
