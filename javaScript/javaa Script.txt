JavaScript keywords are case-sensitive. (so here the apple / APPLE both are the same variable count )

👉 but in that case ( The variables lastName and lastname, are different variables: )




=== JavaScript variable ===

let == it was change the value when user need it (secure ) / you can declare let variableName ones time , second time you not declare let as same name / but you can change the let value

const == const don't change the value (fix value)

var == it was work same as let 

👉 var a ; => that call a declaration of variable
👉 var a = "hello world" => declaration / initialization  variable
